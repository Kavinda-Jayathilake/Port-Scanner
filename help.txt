PORT SCANNER - HELP

Usage:
  python scanner.py <ip> [options]

Description:
  A TCP port scanner built for learning how port scanning works internally.
  Uses sockets, threading, and optional multiprocessing to scan ports.

Target:
  <ip>                Target IPv4 address (e.g. 127.0.0.1)

Options:

  -h
      Show this help message and exit

  -rSTART,END
      Scan a range of ports
      Example:
          -r1,1000

  -pPORTS
      Scan specific ports (comma separated)
      Example:
          -p22,80,443

  -thread
      Set thread level (1–5)
      Higher value = more threads
      Example:
          -thread3

  -procN
      Enable multiprocessing (1–5)
      Splits port range across processes
      Example:
          -proc3

  -tN
      Set socket timeout level (1–5)
      Higher value = longer timeout
      Example:
          -t3

Examples:

  Scan ports 1 to 1000 (default):
      python scanner.py 127.0.0.1 -r1,1000

  Scan common ports with more threads:
      python scanner.py 127.0.0.1 -p22,80,443 -thread4

  Full scan with multiprocessing:
      python scanner.py 127.0.0.1 -r1,65535 -proc3 -thread4 -t3

Notes:
  - Output order is not guaranteed
  - Scan only systems you own or have permission to test
